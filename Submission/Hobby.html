		<p>Actually I don't really have a hobby. I prefer doing a lot of fun activities as long as I enjoy doing them. But most of the time, I enjoy doing sports like badminton, football, volleyball, frisbee and a lot more sports.</p>
    	<p>Besides that, I currently doing Colour Guard which I never know what it is before. After doing it for few months, I joined the competition and won third place.</p>
